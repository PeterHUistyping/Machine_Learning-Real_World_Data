## Zipf’s Law and Heaps’ Law
Zipf’s law says that there is a reverse exponential relationship between the frequency of a word (fw) in a large natural language text, and its relative frequency rank (rw; the ranking of its frequency in comparison with other words’ frequencies) \
Heaps’ law relates the number of distinct words in a text to the overall number of words in the text.
