While I prefer the older animation (8), this is still worth your time. The CGI is impressive & Mowgli interacts well with the animals. It is more serious in tone, making the lighter moments and obligatory songs out of place. I was pleased that the wolves and Shere Khan got more screen time. The cubs and the baby elephant are adorable. I wasn't keen on the re-imagined Baloo and King Louie. (Although, Phil Harris & Louis Prima would be impossible to impersonate.) The elephants, monkeys and vultures don't have speaking roles. Bagheera and Shere Khan are the strongest characters. Kaa is now female and she is given a significant scene. The ending is different. Mowgli is given a more active role. Some nods to The Lion King. It might not be suitable for younger/sensitive children. I liked that they included some of the instrumentals from the classic. A good, alternative version.
