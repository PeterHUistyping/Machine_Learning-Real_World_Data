A fan of the original trilogy I went into this film optimistic that somehow something good has happened since the terrible incarnation that was "The Bourne Legacy" and after watching the original trailer thought it could be a good film.

Turns out I was wrong...

Nicky Parsons, completely underused and only really there as a catalyst to kick off the middle act. Tommy Lee Jones... Ugh! "The Asset" boring.

Choreography was good, some good fight scenes, however encompassed with all so familiar shaky camera!

However the tech side of the film, considering its mostly played out in cybercrime of the CIA is terrible. Its laughable how bad they can mess up something they are basing their structured story on.

**Spoiler Warning**

There's a scene in the film where Bourne sticks a USB drive into a computer that then pings a location via malware to the CIA... this would be viable if they hadn't then shown the layout of all electronics in the area as "offline" except for a mobile phone, of which they then "hack" to create a wireless link to that said laptop!

So how does offline laptop send location data to the CIA? Magic is the only answer.

**End of Spoiler**

In short there are some great set pieces but the story line, acting and so called "twist" are terrible and are nothing short of a movie designed to grab some cash and limelight from what was a good original trilogy.

Wouldn't waste your money on the cinema watching this, I'd wait till its out on DVD or Netflix/Amazon.
