I Remembered Why I love Movies

Throughout the year I watched many movies and by the middle of the year I was finding it hard to watch a movie. I really had to force my self. I thought my love for movies is dying and I'm more of a TV person now. 

I was wrong. 

This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn't me, it was actually the movies I've seen this year.

This movie has it's flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story. I was on the edge of my seat and even after the movie ended I couldn't move for a while. 

A well made film that I recommend to any drama fan. It certainly helped me find my love for movies again.
