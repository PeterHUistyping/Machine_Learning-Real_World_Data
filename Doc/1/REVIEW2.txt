Upon reading the summary of this film I thought this would be a really awesome sci-fi aciton flick but I was highly mistaken.

This film is very bland and visually lacking (which I believe was done to emphasize the uncomfortable feeling of the distopian society but still).
The "love story" in this film is very dry, more phyiscal than anything and it's hard to feel the chemistry.

There are lots of annoying Sci-fi noises in this film (which is common for sci-fi films that are from this time period).

This film does not need many special effects as there are no firefights/gunbattles, but I did like how the director's changes added some nice effects in certain places (although I gotta say the monkey people really threw me off).

I can see why this film was a classic but it was not up to my spoiled expectations in movies.

I would recommend this film for George Lucas fans, extreme film and Sci-Fi fans, and for fans of inherently unique feeling films.

Also the Zeotrope documentary on the bonus disc was very very interesting and neat to watch.
