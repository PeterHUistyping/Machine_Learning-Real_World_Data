What is probably the best part of this film, GRACE, is the pacing. It does not set you up for any roller-coaster ride, nor does it has a million and one flash cut edits, but rather moves towards its ending with a certain tone that is more shivering than horrific.

It is a twisted tale of a mother's love whose power exceeds that of anyone's imagination. After a tragic accident leaving the unborn baby lifeless inside her, Madeline Matheson (Jordan Ladd) decides to carry out the term of her pregnancy with a mid-wife. Once born, however, her love has brought back the child to life - but with unexpected consequences. Once the grandmother gets curious to see the child, things start to get a little bit more complicated.

The child seems to no longer need mothers milk, but rather blood to sustain its life. Very eerie and strange what a mother will go through to satisfy her child, and here is a film that will make you wonder to what extent you might go to save your child.

GRACE is well made and designed, and put together by first time director Paul Solet who also wrote the script, is a satisfying entry into the horror genre. Although there is plenty of blood in this film, it is not really a gory film, nor do I get the sense that this film is attempting at exploiting the genre in any way, which is why it came off more genuine than other horror films. I think the film could be worked out to be scarier, perhaps by building more emotional connection to the characters as they seemed a little on the two dimensional side. They had motivations for their actions, but they did not seem to be based on anything other than because the script said so.

For me, this title is a better rental than buying as I dont feel like its a movie I would return to often. I might give it one more watch to flesh out my thoughts on it, but otherwise it did not leave me with a great impression, other than that it has greater potential than what is presented.
